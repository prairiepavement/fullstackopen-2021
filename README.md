# fullstackopen-2021

This repository contains my submissions for [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en) by the University of Helsinki. 
This course is an introduction to modern JavaScript-based web development utilizing React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. 
The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
